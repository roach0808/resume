I am an ambitious Senior AI Engineer, with 10 years of experience in the Software Development industry. 
My passion for Artificial Intelligence research and development ignited at its very beginning in America. Since then, I’ve been keen on architecting, designing, and implementing top-of-the-line software solutions tailored to the unique needs of businesses. 
My commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements has enabled me to exceed the evolving demands of the digital business landscape. 
My biggest differentiator is my expertise - based upon best practices study, a non-conventional approach that goes beyond the latest tech trends, and proven solutions that best fit business objectives. Whether we’re talking about Product Development, driving projects as a Contractor, I’m enthusiastic about delivering results that transcend expectations. 
My proficiency in AI, MLOps, and System Architecture are not just skill sets. They are components that bridge the gap between real-world solutions and advanced algorithmic strategies.

- Career Experience
InsoftAI, FL, United State
Senior Machine Learning & AI-Agent Engineer & Backend Engineer	02/2023 – present
I led and developed powerful AI-Driven Platforms and ML projects, streaming business operations by integrating AI- driven systems capable of handling up to 90% of customer inquiries.  Developed Support-nGen™, a proprietary system designed to enhance customer service by efficiently managing FAQs, support tickets, and complex queries.
Also, I developed a LLM Twin, an advanced AI character that emulates individual writing/coding styles, voices, and personalities to serve as an effective writing co-pilot, facilitating brand creation by automating the writing process, generating new creative ideas, and streamlining content creation.
? Implemented expertise in implementing a sequential request processing system with a strong emphasis on low latency,  adopting an online real-time inference deployment architecture to enhance overall performance and responsiveness.
? Designed cloud-service/microservice architecture by splitting the ML service into a REST API server for business logic and an optimized LLM microservice, leveraging powerful machines and various engines to enhance latency and memory usage, thereby facilitating quick adaptation of the infrastructure based on different LLM sizes.
? Demonstrated a comprehensive approach by integrating Graph RAG with Neo4j within the business microservice, incorporating advanced RAG techniques to optimize the pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval steps, resulting in enhanced accuracy and improved response, implementing binay quantization solution improving RAG search to 40x faster.
? Utilized Opik to develop a sophisticated dashboard for monitoring complex prompt traces and implemented its Python SDK to effectively evaluate agentic and RAG applications, resulting in enhanced experiment tracking and improved performance comparisons.
? Implemented a highly efficient deployment strategy for the LLM microservice on AWS SageMaker, utilizing Hugging Face’s Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) to enhance model inference. This robust infrastructure supported scalable, secure, and efficient real-time predictions through critical components such as SageMaker endpoints, model configuration, and inference components. By leveraging the Text Generation Inference (TGI) engine, the system achieved superior computational efficiency via tensor and dynamic batching for leading open-source LLMs like Mistral, Llama, and Falcon, accomplished optimizing performance with flash-attention, minimizing model size through model parallelism and weight quantization, enhancing throughput with speculative decoding, continuous batching, accelerating weight loading using safetensors, and enabling real-time interactions via token streaming, culminating in a responsive and effective LLM serving solution and achieving speedups of 2-4x or more.
? Developed and implemented fine-tuning process with Unsloth, a high-performance library, utilizing custom kernels, accelerating training by 2-5x and significantly reducing memory usage by up to 80%. 
? Engineered a business microservice using FastAPI, initially deployed to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), involving Dockerization of the application, pushing the Docker image to AWS ECR, and configuring the deployment, while also orchestrating ML pipelines using ZenML / Airflow, storing and versioning ML pipelines as outputs, and attaching metadata to artifacts for better observability.
? Utilized advanced profiling tools to identify costly lines of code and uncover performance blind spots in local programs and Kubernetes clusters running on Linux, successfully optimizing CPU, GPU, and I/O performance, which led to an estimated 20% reduction in infrastructure costs.
? By integrating Ragas’s strengths in production monitoring and LLM-assisted metrics with ARES’s configurable evaluation process and classifier-based assessments, enhanced evaluation capabilities, achieving quick iterations and in-depth, customized evaluations that significantly improve performance outcomes.
? Designed a clean backend–frontend architecture with FastAPI, built a web API using FastAPI and add WebSocket support agent can respond in real time.
? Exhibited strong leadership abilities by mentoring junior staff, enhancing their communication skills, and encouraging professional development.
